# SmartContract
Smart Contract Management - ETH + AVAX
## Description
Hello everyone, I'm Carl, from 3.4 BSIT and this is my assessment about smart contract. I will show you how to deposit, withdraw and transfer token using MetaMask.    

## Executing Program 
    To get started with the application, ensure that you have MetaMask installed on your browser and connected to the Ethereum network. Then, visit the GitHub repository at https://github.com/MetacrafterChris/SCM-Starter to acquire the template either by cloning or downloading it. Once you have the template downloaded, navigate to the terminal, move to the project directory, and install the necessary dependencies using npm install. Once the dependencies are installed, initiate the development server by executing npm start. This will enable you to access the application via your browser at http://localhost:3000. If your MetaMask wallet is not yet connected, simply click on the "Open My Wallet" button and follow the provided instructions to establish the connection.
